# Adopting Dark Factory in your repo

Audience: maintainers of a repo that wants to consume `@momentiq/dark-factory-cli` + the reusable GitHub Actions workflows published from `momentiq-ai/dark-factory`. After adoption your repo gets:

- **Local subscription-backed critic** on every commit (`.husky/post-commit`) and a pre-push gate (`.husky/pre-push`) — uses your existing Cursor / Codex / Claude / Grok logins (flat-rate) instead of per-token API keys.
- **A PR-gate critic** that runs the same multi-vendor adversarial-critic fleet against every PR HEAD — either the **W3 hosted App** (`dark-factory/critic`, recommended) or the **W1 CI** workflow. Pick one, not both — see §0.
- **Cycle-doc validation** so PRs cite a `Cycle:` or `Issue:` trailer and the validator enforces Spec-Driven Traceability.
- **Binding enforcement** — a branch ruleset that makes your chosen PR-gate critic a *required* status check (`dark-factory/critic` for the hosted App, or `agent-critic / agent-critic` for CI), so red verdicts actually block merges (not just post advisory comments). This is the difference between *installing* Dark Factory and *enforcing* it (§8).
- **Optional branch-protection drift detector** if your repo has a ruleset.

This document is the canonical adoption guide. Concrete worked examples:

- **taxpilot2a F.5a** ([PR #45](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/taxpilot2a/pull/45)) — first external consumer; full CI wiring, `.agent-review/config.json`, `.npmrc` + root `package.json`.
- **taxpilot2a F.5a follow-up** ([PR #46](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/taxpilot2a/pull/46)) — documents the prerequisite `actions/permissions/access` flip on `momentiq-ai/dark-factory` so cross-repo `uses:` works.
- **lyra F.5b** (planned) — second external consumer (under `alien8d/`, fully outside momentiq-ai org).

## 0. Choose your PR-gate critic: W3 hosted (recommended) or W1 CI — never both

Dark Factory runs the **same** multi-vendor adversarial critic fleet against your PRs. You pick **one** substrate as your authoritative PR gate:

- **W3 hosted critic (recommended).** Enroll your repo in the hosted Dark Factory GitHub App. The hosted runtime runs the fleet on Momentiq's compute and posts the **`dark-factory/critic`** check. No CI workflow to maintain, no per-token vendor keys in your repo, and — because it runs server-side with managed keys — it can gate **fork PRs**, which a secret-dependent CI check cannot (§8.4). Enrollment is an org-admin action (App settings → Repository access).
- **W1 CI agent-critic (legacy / self-host).** The `dark-factory-pr.yml` reusable workflows (§6) run the same fleet on GitHub Actions using per-token API keys. Use this only if you are **not** on the hosted App (e.g. air-gapped, or self-hosting the OSS CLI end to end).

> **Do not run both on the same repo.** They are the *same review* on different compute — running both doubles cost, shows two checks for one logical gate, and can produce **conflicting verdicts** (two independent LLM runs disagreeing on one diff). Choose one.

**The local pre-push critic (§3) is kept either way.** It runs at a *different stage* — on your machine, before the PR exists, on flat-rate subscriptions — so it is not a duplicate of either PR-gate critic. It is the fast inner loop that catches blockers before they reach a PR.

### If you choose W3 hosted (recommended)

| Section | Do it? |
|---|---|
| §1–§5 (prerequisites, CLI install, local hooks, `.agent-review/config.json`, cycle docs) | **Yes** — the local layer + traceability are kept. |
| §6 (`dark-factory-pr.yml` CI critic) | **Skip** as a permanent gate. Optionally wire it *transiently* to confirm the hosted critic's verdicts are sound on your repo, then delete it. |
| §8 (enforcement) | **Yes**, but require the **`dark-factory/critic`** context instead of `agent-critic / agent-critic`. |

**Already stood up the W1 CI critic and moving to hosted?** Cut over without an enforcement gap: enroll in W3 → confirm `dark-factory/critic` is green on a real PR → flip your ruleset's required context `agent-critic / agent-critic` → `dark-factory/critic` → delete `dark-factory-pr.yml` and the CI-critic API-key secrets. Keep the local hooks. Never leave the repo ungated between steps.

## 1. Prerequisites

| Item | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub org membership for `momentiq-ai` | Org admin | Required to read the private `@momentiq/dark-factory-cli` npm package. External consumers must fork the repo and self-host the CLI until the 331.3 OSS-flip. |
| npm read token for the `@momentiq` scope | npmjs.com → account → access tokens | Save as `MOMENTIQ_NPM_READ_TOKEN` in your repo's GH Actions secrets and as `$NPM_TOKEN` in your local shell rc (for `npm install`). |
| Node.js >= 20 | `node --version` | The CLI's `engines.node` is `>=20`. |
| `momentiq-ai/dark-factory` Actions access set to `organization` | `gh api -X PUT repos/momentiq-ai/dark-factory/actions/permissions/access -f access_level=organization` (org admin only) | Without this, your `uses: momentiq-ai/dark-factory/.github/workflows/<name>.yml@<sha>` calls fail at startup with "workflow file issue". See [taxpilot2a PR #46](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/taxpilot2a/pull/46) — this trap was discovered the hard way. |

## 2. Install the CLI

Until the 331.3 OSS-flip, the CLI is published to the private `@momentiq` npm scope. Pin to an exact alpha version — floating ranges are not supported (per [`CLAUDE.md` § Consumer-vs-author posture](../CLAUDE.md)).

**a. Root `package.json`** — exact pin in `devDependencies`:

```json
{
  "name": "<your-repo>-host",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "description": "Root manifest hosting @momentiq/dark-factory-cli for the consumer install pattern.",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@momentiq/dark-factory-cli": "0.1.0-alpha.6"
  },
  "engines": { "node": ">=20" }
}
```

Substitute `0.1.0-alpha.6` for the actual latest published alpha. Verify with `npm view @momentiq/dark-factory-cli versions --json` (requires `MOMENTIQ_NPM_READ_TOKEN` exported as `NPM_TOKEN`). If you already have a `package.json` (e.g. a workspaces monorepo), add the devDep to your root manifest — the CLI does not need to live inside any workspace.

**b. `.npmrc`** — interpolated token, never hardcoded:

```ini
@momentiq:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

**c. Install:**

```bash
NPM_TOKEN="<your-token>" npm install
# Binary is now at ./node_modules/.bin/df
./node_modules/.bin/df --help
```

The lockfile (`package-lock.json`) must be committed so CI installs the same version (see `CLAUDE.md` § Reusable workflow conventions — "two paths converge on the same version pin").

## 3. Husky hooks — local critic with subscription auth (the load-bearing piece)

The local critic uses your existing **Cursor / Codex / Claude / Grok SUBSCRIPTIONS** (flat monthly fee, ~$20-200/seat depending on vendor) rather than per-token API keys. This is cost-load-bearing: per-commit critic invocations against pay-per-token APIs cost $1000s/week on busy repos; subscription auth is flat-rate.

Install husky if you don't have it: `npm install --save-dev husky && npx husky init`.

**`.husky/post-commit`** — background critic review for HEAD:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

if [[ "${AGENT_REVIEW_SKIP:-}" == "1" ]]; then
  echo "df review: skipped by AGENT_REVIEW_SKIP=1"
  exit 0
fi

CLI="./node_modules/.bin/df"
if [[ ! -x "${CLI}" ]]; then
  echo "df review: CLI not installed at ${CLI}; run 'npm install' first" >&2
  exit 0   # don't block commits; just warn
fi

COMMON_DIR="$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null || echo .git)"
mkdir -p "${COMMON_DIR}/agent-reviews"
LOG_FILE="${COMMON_DIR}/agent-reviews/post-commit.log"

# Capture SHA at hook time, NOT in the background process. If two
# commits land before the background process starts, the literal
# "HEAD" would resolve to the SECOND commit and the first one would
# never get an artifact — pre-push then blocks on missing-review.
SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"

# Pin the `local` profile so we use Cursor/Codex/Claude subscriptions
# (per `.agent-review/config.json` § profiles.local.auth), not API keys.
AGENT_REVIEW_PROFILE=local nohup "${CLI}" review --commit "${SHA}" \
  >"${LOG_FILE}" 2>&1 \
  </dev/null &
disown || true

echo "df review: critic started for ${SHA:0:12} (log: ${LOG_FILE})"
```

**`.husky/pre-push`** — block push if any pushed commit has unresolved blockers:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

CLI="./node_modules/.bin/df"

# Capture pre-push stdin once so we can feed it to the CLI.
STDIN_BUF="$(cat)"

# Emergency bypass — logged to .git/agent-reviews/_runs.ndjson.
if [[ -n "${AGENT_REVIEW_BYPASS:-}" ]]; then
  echo "df gate-push: BYPASSED — reason: ${AGENT_REVIEW_BYPASS}" >&2
  COMMON_DIR="$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null || echo .git)"
  TELEMETRY_FILE="${COMMON_DIR}/agent-reviews/_runs.ndjson"
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "${TELEMETRY_FILE}")"
  TS="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
  ESC_REASON=$(printf '%s' "${AGENT_REVIEW_BYPASS}" | tr -d '[:cntrl:]' | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g; s/"/\\"/g')
  printf '{"ts":"%s","event":"gate_bypassed","source":"pre-push-hook","reason":"%s"}\n' \
    "${TS}" "${ESC_REASON}" >> "${TELEMETRY_FILE}"
  exit 0
fi

if [[ ! -f "${CLI}" ]]; then
  echo "df gate-push: BLOCKED — CLI not installed at ${CLI}; run 'npm install'." >&2
  echo "df gate-push: push with AGENT_REVIEW_BYPASS=\"reason\" only in genuine emergencies." >&2
  exit 1
fi

# `df gate-push` reads git's pre-push protocol on stdin and gates each
# commit in the pushed range against its per-SHA artifact.
printf '%s' "${STDIN_BUF}" | "${CLI}" gate-push
```

Make both executable:

```bash
chmod +x .husky/post-commit .husky/pre-push
```

**Cost model.** Two-path:

- **Local (default)** — `.agent-review/config.json:profiles.local.auth` pins each vendor to subscription auth (`codex-local-chief-engineer: chatgpt`, etc.). Each commit invokes the critic via the existing CLI login (`cursor-agent`, `codex login`, etc.). Cost = flat monthly subscription.
- **CI (fallback)** — `agent-critic` reusable workflow uses pay-per-token API keys (`CURSOR_API_KEY` / `CODEX_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `XAI_API_KEY`). Per-PR cost varies with diff size but is bounded by the PR cadence, not commit cadence. The intent is that local catches blockers BEFORE the PR exists.

If a developer doesn't have subscriptions configured for any vendor, the local critic degrades to "0 critics ran" and pre-push gate fails closed with a missing-review error. Solve by configuring at least one subscription login, or by running `AGENT_REVIEW_SKIP=1 git commit` for trivial commits (logged to `_runs.ndjson` for audit).

## 4. `.agent-review/config.json` — scope to your repo's source layout

Copy the [dark-factory canonical config](../.agent-review/config.json) into your repo and adjust three things:

- **`tdd.classifier.productionGlobs` / `testGlobs`** — point at your repo's actual source/test layout.
- **`profiles.local.criticIds`** — the minimum quorum-2 envelope is `["cursor-local-chief-engineer", "codex-local-chief-engineer"]` per the canonical config's `aggregation.quorum: 2`. Add more critics if you want stricter consensus.
- **`context.guidanceFiles`** — list your repo's CLAUDE.md / ENGINEERING.md / equivalent files. The critic loads these into its prompt envelope.

`min-complete-quorum: 2` is the recommended aggregation policy: a verdict is binding only when at least 2 critics complete; per-critic errors (rate limits, expired subs) don't block the gate. See `CLAUDE.md` § Iteration-trap for the N=2 ceiling — same policy applies to consumer repos.

Also drop a critic-prompt fragment at `.agent-review/prompts/local-critic.md` with your repo-specific quality bar. See [dark-factory's own](../.agent-review/prompts/local-critic.md) as a starting template.

### 4.1 Deterministic schema-lint critic (`static-schema-lint`)

In addition to the LLM critics, the local fleet ships a **deterministic** critic that runs JSON-Schema validation on schema-annotated code blocks inside changed `*.md` files. It has **no API key, no subscription, no network call** — pure `ajv`-backed validation. Runtime: <100ms per PR.

**Why it exists.** Consumer dark-factory-platform#107: a `~/.claude/settings.json` example documenting `effortLevel: "max"` (schema-invalid — the persisted enum is `low|medium|high|xhigh`) sailed past the local quorum (cursor-cli + codex) and was caught by the cloud `cursor-sdk` adapter. The local LLM critics are not optimized for schema-shape regressions in tiny code-block examples. A deterministic backstop closes the gap.

**Adapter id.** `static-schema-lint`. Critic-id template: `<name>-schema-lint-chief-engineer` (the local profile uses `schema-lint-chief-engineer`).

**Wire it in.** Add the critic + the id to your local profile (cloud profile gets it too — same deterministic result either side, belt-and-suspenders). Quorum stays unchanged: schema-lint is `required: false` and its job is to surface **blocking-severity findings** that veto regardless of quorum (the existing single-critic-veto pattern under `min-complete-quorum`).

**Source of markdown content.** The adapter prefers `changedFiles[i].content` when the consumer config has `context.includeFullChangedFiles: true` (the recommended default — that's what dark-factory itself uses). When `includeFullChangedFiles: false`, the adapter falls back to reconstructing added markdown lines from `packet.diff` so the gate still surfaces regressions; deletion-only hunks are correctly ignored. Set `includeFullChangedFiles: true` if you want the adapter to scan the full file (catches annotations in unmodified context); leave it `false` if you want it to scan only the `+` lines of the current change. Either way the DFP #107 fixture is blocked end-to-end.

**Verify the wiring with `df doctor`.** After adding the critic, run `df doctor` (or invoke the MCP `df_doctor` tool from your agent client). Confirm two checks pass:

- `schema-lint-chief-engineer.static_schema_lint_registry` — the registry compiled and reports the built-in schema count.
- `schema-lint-chief-engineer.static_schema_lint_smoke` — a known-good `effortLevel: "high"` payload validates clean against the bundled `claude-code-settings` schema.

If either check is missing, the MCP loader didn't pick up the adapter (open an issue against `momentiq-ai/dark-factory`). If the smoke check fails, re-install: `npm ci --workspace=@momentiq/dark-factory-cli`.

<!-- schema: df-agent-review-config -->
```jsonc
{
  "version": 2,
  "critics": [
    {
      "id": "schema-lint-chief-engineer",
      "name": "Schema-Lint Critic",
      "adapter": "static-schema-lint",
      "required": false,
      "runtime": "local",
      "model": { "id": "deterministic-1.0", "params": [] }
    }
  ],
  "profiles": {
    "local": {
      "criticIds": [
        "cursor-local-chief-engineer",
        "codex-local-chief-engineer",
        "schema-lint-chief-engineer"
      ],
      "quorum": 2
    }
  }
}
```

**Authoring schema-linted examples.** Two annotation forms — pick whichever fits the fence language:

JSONC (the common case — comments allowed):

<!-- schema: claude-code-settings -->
```jsonc
// schema: claude-code-settings
{ "model": "opus", "effortLevel": "xhigh" }
```

Strict JSON (no inline comments) — use the HTML-comment form IMMEDIATELY before the fence:

<!-- schema: claude-code-settings -->
```json
{ "model": "opus", "effortLevel": "xhigh" }
```

Both forms above will be validated; the value `"effortLevel": "max"` would produce a `severity: high` finding in either form. YAML fences use `# schema: <name>` and are parsed via the `yaml` package:

<!-- schema: claude-code-settings -->
```yaml
# schema: claude-code-settings
model: opus
effortLevel: "xhigh"
```

Block-comment-friendly fences use `/* schema: <name> */`. Built-in schema names: `claude-code-settings`, `df-agent-review-config`. Extend via the `schemas` constructor option if you have additional shapes worth linting.

**Unknown schema names are blocking.** A typo in the annotation (e.g. `// schema: claude-code-setting` missing the trailing `s`) emits a `severity: high` finding so the misconfiguration surfaces at gate time instead of failing open. Register the schema or fix the annotation.

**What it does NOT do.** It does not auto-detect schemas from file paths (the opt-in annotation is required — false positives erode trust faster than false negatives). It does not call any LLM. It does not validate the full markdown body — only annotated code blocks.

## 5. `docs/roadmap/cycles/` — Spec-Driven Traceability (MANDATORY)

Per the AI-Native Manifesto §10 (`sage3c:docs/engineering/ai-native-manifesto.md`), Dark Factory consumer repos MUST carry a `docs/roadmap/cycles/` directory containing cycle docs. The `cycle-doc-validation` reusable workflow (extracted from `sage3c/scripts/ci/validate_cycle_doc.py`) enforces:

- Every code PR cites either a `Cycle: <N>` or `Issue: #<N>` trailer (or GitHub auto-close keyword).
- The cited cycle doc exists at `docs/roadmap/cycles/cycle<N>-*.md` with valid frontmatter (`status: draft | in-progress | completed | superseded | abandoned | absorbed`).
- A PR cannot cite a terminal-status cycle (`completed` / `complete` / `superseded` / `abandoned` / `absorbed`).
- Plan PRs change exactly one cycle doc; code PRs reference the corresponding plan.

**Bootstrap seed:** create `docs/roadmap/cycles/cycle1-dark-factory-adoption.md` as your first plan PR, with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
cycle: 1
title: "Cycle 1 — Adopt Dark Factory"
status: in-progress
priority: high
created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
started: "YYYY-MM-DD"
completed: null
owner: "@<your-handle>"
tags:
  - dark-factory
  - adoption
---
```

Subsequent PRs in your repo cite `Cycle: 1` or, for tactical follow-ups after closure, `Issue: #<N>`. See [sage3c's cycle directory](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/sage3c/tree/main/docs/roadmap/cycles) for the corpus this validator was designed against.

## 6. `.github/workflows/dark-factory-pr.yml` — invoke the reusable workflows

> **Legacy / transitional for W3-enrolled repos.** If you adopt the **W3 hosted App** (§0, recommended) you do **not** need this CI workflow as a permanent gate — `dark-factory/critic` is your authoritative gate. Wire `dark-factory-pr.yml` only if you self-host the critic (not on the hosted App), or *transiently* to validate the hosted critic before deleting it. Running both the CI critic and the hosted critic on one repo is a duplicate gate (see §0).

Pin each reusable workflow to an exact **commit SHA** (NOT a `@v0` tag — per `CLAUDE.md` § Reusable workflow conventions, only `@vX.Y.Z` semver tags and commit SHAs are supported; floating `@v0`/`@v0.1` tags don't exist).

```yaml
# .github/workflows/dark-factory-pr.yml
# Prereq: momentiq-ai/dark-factory actions/permissions/access must be
# set to 'organization' (org admin only). See taxpilot2a#46.

**Caller job-id naming (load-bearing — read before writing your ruleset).** A reusable workflow invoked via `uses:` produces a status-check context of the form **`<caller-job-id> / <callee-job-name>`**, NOT the bare callee name. Every dark-factory reusable workflow deliberately omits a job-level `name:` override so the callee segment defaults to the job id, giving consumers a uniform `<id> / <id>` contract: `agent-critic:` → **`agent-critic / agent-critic`**, `cycle-doc-validation:` → **`cycle-doc-validation / cycle-doc-validation`**, and `pr-status-check:` → **`pr-status-check / pr-status-check`** (issue #27 — a prior `name: "PR Status Check"` override broke the contract and permanently blocked merges). This is the EXACT string your ruleset must require in §8 — requiring the bare `agent-critic` would never match and would block every PR forever. See `README.md` § Consumer-side wiring for the contract, and §8 below to make the check binding.

See [taxpilot2a's dark-factory-pr.yml](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/taxpilot2a/blob/main/.github/workflows/dark-factory-pr.yml) for a working production example pinned to a real commit SHA.

## 7. Provision secrets on your repo's GH Actions

| Secret | When | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `MOMENTIQ_NPM_READ_TOKEN` | Always | Consumer install path resolves `@momentiq/dark-factory-cli@<pinned>` from the private npm scope. |
| `CURSOR_API_KEY` | Optional but recommended | CI critic fallback when subscription auth isn't available in the runner (it isn't). |
| `CODEX_API_KEY` | Optional but recommended | Same. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional | Wires the Gemini critic in CI. Missing keys produce `status=error` for that critic; min-complete-quorum handles gracefully. |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | Optional | Same for Grok. |
| `CI_BOT_APP_ID` + `CI_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` | Only if using `branch-protection-audit` with `gate-enabled: 'true'` | Mints an installation token via `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` for the drift audit. |

Set with:

```bash
gh secret set MOMENTIQ_NPM_READ_TOKEN --repo <your-org>/<your-repo>
gh secret set CURSOR_API_KEY --repo <your-org>/<your-repo>
# ... etc
```

## 8. Make Dark Factory binding (required for enforcement)

**This is the step that turns Dark Factory from advisory to enforcing. Skipping it is the single most common adoption failure.**

Everything up to here makes the gates *run* and *post verdicts*. None of it makes them *block a merge*. The local Husky `pre-push` hook (§3) gates `git push` on your own machine — but it does nothing for merges that go through the GitHub UI, the merge queue, an auto-merge, a PR opened from another machine, or anything that bypasses the local hook. **CI enforcement is what gates the merge queue.** Without a ruleset that requires the `agent-critic` status check, a PR with red critic findings merges anyway — exactly what happened to `taxpilot2a` PR #48 (merged ~4 minutes before `agent-critic` finished, with the critic's findings landing on `main` unguarded; tracked at [`momentiq-ai/sage3c#2213`](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/sage3c/issues/2213)).

> **Rulesets are NOT optional for enforcement.** Earlier sections describe `branch-protection-audit` as an *optional* drift detector — that audit is genuinely optional. **Requiring the `agent-critic` check is not.** If you want Dark Factory to actually block anything, you must require it. "Installed Dark Factory" and "enforcing Dark Factory" are two different states; this section closes the gap between them.

### 8.1 Apply the enforcement ruleset

> **W3 hosted repos:** require the **`dark-factory/critic`** context (posted by the hosted App) instead of `agent-critic / agent-critic`. The JSON below shows the W1/CI contexts — swap `agent-critic / agent-critic` for `dark-factory/critic` if your authoritative gate is the hosted App (§0). Everything else in this section applies unchanged.

Create a branch ruleset on your repo that requires (a) the `agent-critic` status check to be green and (b) all bot review threads to be resolved before merge. The payload below is repo-agnostic — you target your repo in the `gh api` path, not in the JSON. Save it as `main-enforcement.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "dark-factory-enforcement",
  "target": "branch",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "conditions": {
    "ref_name": { "exclude": [], "include": ["refs/heads/main"] }

          { "context": "agent-critic / agent-critic", "integration_id": 15368 },
          { "context": "cycle-doc-validation / cycle-doc-validation", "integration_id": 15368 }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply it (replace `<your-org>/<your-repo>`):

```bash
# Create the ruleset (first time):
gh api -X POST repos/<your-org>/<your-repo>/rulesets \
  --input main-enforcement.json

# Update an existing ruleset (get its id from `gh api repos/<your-org>/<your-repo>/rulesets`):
gh api -X PUT repos/<your-org>/<your-repo>/rulesets/<ruleset-id> \
  --input main-enforcement.json
```

Verify it took:

```bash
gh api repos/<your-org>/<your-repo>/rulesets --jq '.[] | {id, name, enforcement}'
```

### 8.2 The required context string MUST match your caller job-id

The single detail that breaks this step: **the required context must be the EXACT string your CI emits.** Per §6 (Caller job-id naming), a reusable workflow invoked via `uses:` emits the context `<caller-job-id> / <callee-job-name>`. With the caller job declared `agent-critic:` (as in §6), the context is **`agent-critic / agent-critic`** — that is what the JSON above requires. If you renamed your caller job, or wired the workflow differently, run this against a recent PR of yours and require **whatever string actually appears**:

```bash
# Inspect the real context strings your CI produced on a recent PR:
gh pr view <pr-number> --repo <your-org>/<your-repo> \
  --json statusCheckRollup \
  --jq '.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.workflowName | test("Dark Factory";"i")) | .name'
# Expect: "agent-critic / agent-critic", "cycle-doc-validation / cycle-doc-validation", ...
```

Requiring a context that never reports leaves every PR **blocked forever** waiting on a check that will never arrive (the same failure class as requiring a secret-dependent check on fork PRs — see the caveat below). Require only contexts you have *observed* reporting.

`integration_id: 15368` pins each context to the GitHub Actions app (a global constant across GitHub), so a status of the same name posted by a different app cannot satisfy the requirement. It is optional but recommended; drop it only if you require the same context name from a non-Actions integration.

### 8.3 Which checks to require (and which not to)

| Context | Require by default? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `dark-factory/critic` | **YES — for W3 hosted repos** | The hosted App's critic check, and the authoritative gate for repos enrolled in the W3 App. Require this *instead of* `agent-critic / agent-critic` (§0). |
| `agent-critic / agent-critic` | **YES — for W1/self-host repos only** | The CI critic. Require it only if you are *not* on the W3 hosted App. Without a required PR-gate critic, verdicts are advisory and merges aren't blocked. Do **not** require both this and `dark-factory/critic`. |
| `cycle-doc-validation / cycle-doc-validation` | **YES** | Spec-Driven Traceability is mandatory for consumers (§5). The validator reliably reports on every consumer PR. |
| `branch-protection-audit / branch-protection-audit` | No | Usually wired with `gate-enabled: 'false'` (§6) → it's a documented no-op pass. Requiring a no-op check adds no safety. Require it only once you flip `gate-enabled: 'true'` and provision its App token. |
| `schema-check / *` | No | The dark-factory `schema-check` workflow validates `@momentiq/dark-factory-schemas` specifically; for your own OpenAPI / JSON Schema drift you typically wire your own `schema-check`. Don't require dark-factory's unless your CI actually runs it and it reports. |
| `pr-status-check / pr-status-check` | Optional | A no-op sentinel aggregator (always exits 0). Requiring it only proves the Dark Factory PR workflow ran; it carries no quality signal. Add it if you want a liveness assertion. |

The minimum binding configuration is just **`agent-critic / agent-critic`**. The JSON above also requires `cycle-doc-validation / cycle-doc-validation` because traceability is mandatory for consumers; drop that line if your repo genuinely doesn't run the cycle-doc validator yet.

### 8.4 Caveat — fork PRs cannot satisfy a secret-dependent required check

Once `agent-critic` is required, **external fork PRs become unmergeable through the normal flow**: fork PRs run without access to your repository secrets (`MOMENTIQ_NPM_READ_TOKEN`, `CURSOR_API_KEY`, …), so the `agent-critic` job cannot install the CLI or reach the critic vendors, and the required check never goes green. This is by design (GitHub withholds secrets from fork-triggered runs to prevent secret exfiltration) and is the same class of problem tracked at [`momentiq-ai/dark-factory#15`](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/dark-factory/issues/15). Until the 331.3 fork-handling design ships, maintainers must **internalize external contributions** — re-create the fork's branch inside the upstream repo (where secrets are available) and merge that — rather than merging the fork PR directly. If your repo takes no external fork contributions, this caveat does not affect you.

## 9. Validation

**a. Local — `df doctor`:**

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/df doctor
```

This verifies:
- Node version meets `engines.node`.
- Husky hooks directory exists, hook scripts are executable.
- `core.hooksPath` points at `.husky`.
- Artifact dir is writable.
- Doppler bootstrap (if configured).
- Per-adapter `doctor()` — i.e., each vendor's subscription login works.

Fix every red row before opening your first PR.

**b. First PR.** Open a no-op PR that touches `docs/CONSUMER-ADOPTION.md` or similar low-risk file. Expect:

- `pr-status-check / pr-status-check` → PASS (sentinel).
- `cycle-doc-validation / cycle-doc-validation` → PASS (with a valid `Cycle: 1` or `Issue: #<N>` trailer).
- `agent-critic / agent-critic` → PASS or advisory findings (degrade-and-pass under min-complete-quorum).
- `branch-protection-audit / branch-protection-audit` → PASS with `gate-enabled: 'false'`.

After §8, the `agent-critic / agent-critic` and `cycle-doc-validation / cycle-doc-validation` contexts are *required* — the merge queue will not admit a PR until they report green and every bot review thread is resolved. Confirm enforcement is live by checking that the PR's merge box shows these as **Required** checks.

First-time critic runs are advisory (the policy is `aggregation.blockOnReviewError: false` per the canonical config). Treat the first 1-2 PRs as calibration: tighten `.agent-review/prompts/local-critic.md` and the config until critic findings are signal, not noise. A consequence: while the critic is still in calibration it degrades-and-passes, so the required check stays green even with advisory findings — enforcement bites once the critic emits actual `state=BLOCKING` verdicts.

## 9.5 Inspect critic artifacts from the shell — `df show` / `df status`

After `df review` writes a per-commit artifact to `.git/agent-reviews/<sha>.json`, two CLI subcommands inspect it without `jq`-pipelines or hand-rolled JSON parsing. Both are thin CLI mirrors of the `df_show_run` / `df_findings` MCP tools and share the same backend, so an operator's shell-side view and an agent's MCP-side view are guaranteed to match.

| Subcommand | Default output | `--json` shape | MCP tool mirror |
|---|---|---|---|
| `df show [--commit <ref>] [--json]` | Rich text block — commit, status, verdict, range, aggregation, createdAt, per-critic lines, optional bypass block | `{ artifact: <full ReviewArtifact> }` | `df_show_run` |
| `df status [--commit <ref>] [--json]` | Terse text block — short commit + verdict + one line per critic | `{ commit, critics: [{ id, status, verdict?, findings: [{ severity, file?, line?, rule, message }] }] }` | `df_findings` |

Both subcommands:

- default `--commit` to `HEAD`,
- accept any ref `git rev-parse` accepts (SHA, `HEAD`, branch, tag, `HEAD~1`, …),
- exit `0` on success, `1` if no artifact / config / git resolve fails (with a stderr message that includes the resolved SHA and a `df review` remediation hint), `2` on unknown flags.

The `--json` outputs are **byte-equivalent** with their MCP-tool counterparts' `structuredContent` envelopes (cycle 5 spec). Pipelines that read either surface get the same shape.

```bash
# Inspect HEAD's full review artifact (rich text):
./node_modules/.bin/df show

# Inspect a specific commit, as structured JSON for downstream tooling:
./node_modules/.bin/df show --commit 1a2b3c4d --json | jq '.artifact.gateVerdict'

# Terse verdict + per-critic status, for a quick check or a CI step:
./node_modules/.bin/df status

# Narrowed findings list, byte-equivalent with df_findings — useful for
# gating shell pipelines on findings without re-parsing the full artifact:
./node_modules/.bin/df status --json | jq '.critics[] | select(.findings[].severity == "blocker")'
```

`df show --help` and `df status --help` list flags and exit codes inline.

## 10. Update cadence

- Pin to a specific alpha/beta version (`0.1.0-alpha.N`) — never floating ranges.
- Bump CLI deliberately when dark-factory releases a new version. Check the [changelog](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/dark-factory/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) (when it lands in Phase F+) or the [release tags](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/dark-factory/tags).
- When bumping, update both `package.json` (`devDependencies."@momentiq/dark-factory-cli"`) AND `.github/workflows/dark-factory-pr.yml` (`with: cli-version:`). The `df doctor` subcommand surfaces drift between them.
- Reusable workflow SHA bumps are decoupled: you can bump the CLI without bumping the workflow SHA and vice versa. Test in a draft PR before landing in main.

## 11. Wire the MCP server into your agent

`@momentiq/dark-factory-cli@0.2.0-alpha.0+` ships a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server as the `df mcp` subcommand. Any MCP-speaking agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini) can connect over stdio and get a structured tool + resource + prompt catalog instead of shelling out to `df` and parsing stdout. See [cycle 5](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/dark-factory-platform/blob/main/docs/roadmap/cycles/cycle5-mcp-server.md) for the spec.

### What you get

19 tools (read-only + write), 9 URI-addressable resources, and 7 prompts. Highlights:

- `df_doctor` — env verification (Node, hooks, vendor auth, Doppler) as structured `{ ok, checks }`
- `df_findings(commit)` — narrowed per-critic findings for a SHA (CLI mirror: `df status --json`, see §9.5)
- `df_show_run(commit)` — full ReviewArtifact JSON for a SHA (CLI mirror: `df show --json`, see §9.5)
- `df_cycle_list` / `df_cycle_read(cycle_id)` — your repo's cycle docs as structured `{ frontmatter, sections }`
- `df_adr_list` / `df_adr_read(adr_id)` — ADRs under `docs/ADR/`
- `df_critics_config` — parsed `.agent-review/config.json` (narrowed view)
- `df_stats({since?, until?})` / `df_gate_push({stdin_protocol})` — audit + pre-push gate
- `df_review` (async) / `df_review_status(job_id)` — kick off + poll a critic run
- `df_bypass({reason, sha, issue_url?})` — record an audit-logged emergency bypass; elicits a missing `issue_url` from the user when the client supports MCP elicitation
- `df_cycle_doc_generate` / `df_adr_generate` — server asks the **client's** LLM (via MCP sampling) to populate a skeleton, validates, writes the file
- `df_handoff` / `df_handoffs` / `df_accept` / `df_rehydrate` — the agent handoff protocol (see [§12](#12-session-continuity--the-agent-handoff-protocol))

Resources at `df://repo/cycles`, `df://repo/cycle/{id}`, `df://repo/adrs`, `df://repo/adr/{id}`, `df://repo/findings/{sha}`, `df://repo/runs/recent[?limit]`, `df://repo/config/critics`, `df://repo/audit-log[?since]`, `df://repo/principles`.

Prompts (pure templates the client's LLM consumes): `df.write_cycle_doc`, `df.draft_adr`, `df.diagnose_critic_failure`, `df.summarize_recent_runs`, `df.onboarding_analysis`, `df.handoff`, `df.rehydrate`.

### Configuration — Claude Code (`.mcp.json`)

Add this to your repo's `.mcp.json` (project root):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dark-factory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["df", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_REVIEW_PROFILE": "local"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code will spawn `df mcp` as a subprocess on session start and the catalog appears under the `dark-factory` server in the model's tool surface.

### Configuration — Cursor (`~/.cursor/mcp.json` or project-local)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dark-factory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["df", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AGENT_REVIEW_PROFILE": "local"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration — Codex (`.codex/config.toml`)

```toml
[mcp_servers.dark-factory]
command = "npx"
args = ["df", "mcp"]
env = { AGENT_REVIEW_PROFILE = "local" }
```

### Configuration — Gemini CLI (`~/.gemini/settings.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dark-factory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["df", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Smoke-test the wiring

After configuring your agent, start a new session and ask:

> "Use the dark-factory MCP server to call `df_doctor` and summarize the result."

The agent should connect, list tools, call `df_doctor`, and render the structured `{ ok, checks }` output. If the call fails, the agent will surface a clear remediation (missing config, wrong cwd, etc.) — no log-parsing required.

### What the MCP server is NOT

- **It does not replace the `df` CLI.** Husky hooks, GHA workflows, scripted CI, and human-driven invocations all keep using the CLI. The MCP server is for agent ↔ Dark Factory interaction specifically.
- **No `resources/subscribe` in this release.** Subscriptions land in cycle 5 Phase 2 (the remote HTTP MCP gateway at `mcp.dark-factory.momentiq.ai`). Phase 1 stdio clients poll if they need freshness.
- **The protocol version pinned for this release is `2025-06-18`.** Newer clients negotiate to whichever supported version they prefer; older clients negotiate down. The SDK manages this — you do nothing.

## 12. Session continuity — the agent handoff protocol (Cycle 12 Issue-anchor)

`@momentiq/dark-factory-cli` (alpha tag past `0.6.0-alpha.9`) ships four verbs that carry an
agent's *working context* across a session boundary (reboot, local-model
upgrade, dev→dev, dev→cloud-agent). The **state** of a work-stream (branch, diff,
CI, mergeability) is recoverable from `gh`/the linked PR(s); the **reasoning**
(why this approach, what was rejected, traps hit, where you were mid-thought)
is not — it evaporates with the session. The verbs anchor that reasoning on a
**dedicated handoff GitHub Issue** (created by `/handoff`, links *outward* to
zero or more PRs/issues, closed by `/accept` when the next session records the
baton) and model the **baton** entirely on native GitHub primitives — **no new
system, no extra service, no state file**:

- a **`handoff` label** = lineage (survives close — closed handoff Issues are
  the audit trail, queryable via `gh issue list --label handoff --state closed`),
- the **assignee** = who holds the baton (empty = on the stack, `@me` = claimed),
- the **issue timeline** = the assignment + close audit (recorded for free).

**Cycle 12 protocol upgrade** (was: Cycle 8 PR-anchor; this is the v2
Issue-anchor redesign):

- The arg shape changed: `[pr]` → `[issue]` across all four verbs. There is **no
  compat shim** — pin past the first Cycle 12.2 alpha (computed by
  release-please on merge — past `0.6.0-alpha.9`) and adopt the new arg
  shape.
- The slash-command `.md` heredoc surface (which existed in Cycle 8 to wrap the
  bash scripts under Claude Code's `$ARGUMENTS` substitution) is gone. The TS CLI
  takes real argv directly, structurally closing the heredoc-breakout
  trust-model surface the v1 critic kept flagging.
- `git push` is no longer a side-effect of `df handoff`. The handoff event is
  bounded to the Issue lifecycle (open → unassigned/assigned → closed by
  `/accept`). Push your branch yourself when you're ready.

Available identically as CLI subcommands and MCP tools (the [§11](#11-wire-the-mcp-server-into-your-agent)
server exposes the same logic), plus MCP prompts that carry the judgment:

| Verb | CLI | MCP tool | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hand off | `df handoff [issue] [--link <ref>]... [--unlink <ref>]... [--new] < note.md` | `df_handoff` | Pausing / ending / switching away |
| List the stack | `df handoffs` | `df_handoffs` | Fresh start — what's available? |
| Accept | `df accept <issue>` | `df_accept` | Take over a handoff (claim + rehydrate + close — Commitment 10) |
| Rehydrate | `df rehydrate [issue]` | `df_rehydrate` | Resume your *own* in-flight work (read-only); no-arg → 2-tier lookup (open+@me, then closed+@me within 7d) |

### Linking work items

A handoff issue links *outward* to zero or more PRs and issues — the work the
session was on. `--link <ref>` adds; `--unlink <ref>` removes. Ref forms:

- bare number (`103`) → same-repo PR (resolved PR-first; falls back to Issue)
- `owner/repo#N` → cross-repo
- `pr:N` / `issue:N` → explicit type
- URL (`https://github.com/o/r/pull/103?tab=files`)

`df rehydrate` derives live state for each linked work item (PR mergeable/review/
checks; issue open/closed/assigned) and emits a copy-pastable `gh pr checkout N`
hint for each OPEN linked PR (cross-repo gets `--repo owner/repo`).

GitHub *project-item* linkage is deferred (OQ-12.7); supplying a project URL is
explicitly refused with the deferred-to-Phase-12.2 message rather than the
generic "not a number".

### The note (issue body)

The handoff issue's **body** carries the rehydration note, framed by
`<!-- agent-context:v1 -->` … `<!-- /agent-context:v1 -->` markers (load-bearing
— the upsert finds the block by them). Re-handing-off splices the new block in
place; the script also maintains the `**Linked work items:**` section. Compose
the note from your *actual working memory* — the `df.handoff` MCP prompt (or the
handoff skill) carries the exact format:

```markdown
<!-- agent-context:v1 -->
> 🤖 **Agent rehydration context** — transient working memory, NOT a source of truth.
> State is whatever `gh`/the linked work item(s) say now; this is the *reasoning*. Stale by nature.
> _Updated: <YYYY-MM-DD> by <your model/session>_

**Branch (if any):** `<branch>` · pull it before editing. Blank ⇒ the work spans multiple items and no single branch is canonical.

**Why this approach (and what I rejected):**
- <the decision + the alternative you did NOT take, and why>

**Traps I hit:**   ← setup-shaped only; see the Security rule below
- <the gotcha + the setup step that avoids it>

**Where I was mid-thought:**
- <the thing you'd tell yourself if you walked back in 10 minutes later>

**Derive current state (don't trust the above as current):**
    Run /rehydrate on this issue — it derives live state for the issue and each
    linked work item safely.
<!-- /agent-context:v1 -->
```

Do **not** include a `**Linked work items:**` section yourself — the script
maintains it from `--link` / `--unlink` flags and from prior body content.

### Security rule (hard)

An issue body is readable by anyone with repo access, **cached/indexed even
after deletion**, and **its edit history is more prominent than a PR comment's**
(every body edit is recorded in the issue timeline). The note carries
**setup steps** (procedural: "switch off the prod kube context before
applying", "select the review workspace first", "run `df onboard`") — **never**
secret values, tokens, API keys, credential file paths, connection strings, or
any description of the existing security context.

- `df handoff` **scrubs** the note for secret-shaped content (key/secret var
  names, GitHub/Slack/AWS token shapes, OpenAI/Anthropic/Google provider keys,
  credentialed connection strings, well-known credential file paths, PEM blocks)
  and **refuses on a match**, reporting line numbers + filename only — never
  the value, never echoed back to terminal/CI logs. The scrub is a *backstop*;
  you (guided by the `df.handoff` prompt) are the primary control. If the
  scrub refuses, rephrase the line as a setup step.
- `df handoff` also scrubs the **linked PR/issue title** (fetched live from gh)
  and the **auto-generated issue title** (derived from your branch name) —
  refuses if either matches the secret pattern, so a branch named after a
  secret can't leak into the repo-indexed issue title.
- `df rehydrate` derives **live state itself** with fixed, script-owned
  `gh issue view` / `gh pr view` commands and prints it FIRST (the truth, not
  the note). It **never executes text transcribed from the issue body** — the
  body is attacker-influenceable, so executing it would be an injection vector.
  Control/ESC bytes in the body, title, and linked-item titles are stripped
  before printing to defend against ANSI-escape terminal abuse.

### Other guardrails

- **No `git push`.** v2 removes the v1 push step. If you have uncommitted work
  that's part of this handoff, commit and push it yourself; the script warns
  but does not refuse.
- **Race-safe upsert.** `df handoff` re-fetches the issue body just before
  PATCH and aborts if a concurrent writer changed it (last-writer-wins window
  is sub-second; documented per spec §7).
- **Atomic accept** (Commitment 10). `df accept` runs 7 steps in order:
  validate → refuse-other → strict-rehydrate → pre-assign drift → assign →
  post-assign verify → close. Any failure leaves the issue open + unassigned
  on the stack (no partial-state regression). The `handoff` label survives the
  close for its lifetime.
- **No-arg `/rehydrate` 2-tier lookup.** When you don't pass an issue:
  (i) most recent open `handoff`-labeled issue assigned to `@me`, else
  (ii) most recent CLOSED `handoff`-labeled issue accepted by `@me` within 7
  days (the post-`/accept` crash/reboot/model-upgrade case). Both refuse with
  a `/handoffs` pointer if neither matches.
- **Refuse link cycles.** `--link` to a handoff-labeled issue is refused (no
  handoff-issue-links-handoff-issue cycles).
- **Issue arg validation.** A non-positive-integer issue arg is rejected by
  `requireIssueNumber` before any `gh` call, plus a defense-in-depth allow-list
  on the full argv (rejects shell metacharacters even though TS real argv
  structurally closes the injection vector).

### Wiring

The verbs need `gh` (authenticated) on PATH — the same dependency the cycle-doc
and branch-protection subcommands already use. No extra config. As MCP tools
they are exposed automatically by the [§11](#11-wire-the-mcp-server-into-your-agent)
server, so an MCP-wired agent discovers `df_handoff` / `df_accept` /
`df_rehydrate` / `df_handoffs` (Issue-anchored; PR-arg removed)
without any prompting. The MCP tools return both `structuredContent` (typed
shape for clients that consume it) and `content[0].text` (bash-compatible
rendered text for clients that don't).

## 13. Cloud environments — running Claude Code from a sandbox or Codespace

The Dark Factory pre-push gate's local critic profile uses **subscription-backed** auth (Cursor + Codex via Keychain-backed OAuth) — by design, no API keys live on the workstation. That works on a laptop with a browser. It does **not** work in a cloud sandbox (`claude.ai/code`, GitHub Codespaces, browser-driven environments) where OAuth has nowhere to redirect.

Two surfaces are scaffolded to make running Claude Code against your repo from a cloud environment a one-step bootstrap, while still routing through the **W3 hosted critic** as the merge gate:

| Surface | Use it when | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Web cloud env** (`claude.ai/code`) | Browser-only, fastest spin-up, ephemeral per session | Paste a setup script into the env-config dialog. |
| **Devcontainer** (`.devcontainer/`) | Versioned in repo, encrypted per-user secrets, browser-based (Codespaces) or local-host integration (VS Code Reopen-in-Container) | Reproducible Docker dev env; OS tooling baked into the image; per-developer config in `post-create.sh`. |

Both skip the local subscription critics (cloud OAuth can't reach a browser). Pushes from either cite the canonical reason string so they audit cleanly:

```bash
AGENT_REVIEW_BYPASS="cloud env — local quorum unavailable; W3 critic is the gate" git push
```

The bypass is **loud + audited** — `.git/agent-reviews/_runs.ndjson` records the reason verbatim and `make df-stats` surfaces it. The merge gate is the **hosted W3 critic** (`dark-factory/critic`), enforced by your repo's branch ruleset (§8). Cloud-env pushes are a *cooperation pattern* with the hosted gate, not a defeat of it.

### 13.1 Sage-blueprint consumers (recommended path)

Repos scaffolded from [`momentiq-ai/sage-blueprint`](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/sage-blueprint) with `enable_agent_review=true` get the cloud-env scaffold automatically, gated on the same `enable_agent_review` flag as the rest of the consumer shape. Five files land in `template/{{ '{{' }} product_slug {{ '}}' }}/`:

- `.devcontainer/{devcontainer.json,Dockerfile,post-create.sh}` — Codespaces + local VS Code surface. Templated on `product_slug`, `doppler_project`, `doppler_config`, `github_org`. Includes the `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/sshd:1` feature so `gh codespace ssh` works from a laptop CLI (needed for automated verification — without it `gh codespace ssh` errors with `failed to start SSH server`).
- `scripts/cloud-bootstrap-web.sh` — paste-into-`claude.ai/code` setup script. Same idempotent npm/git/Doppler/df-doctor flow as the devcontainer post-create. Lives in-repo so it's reviewable, diffable, and the runbook can link to a specific revision.
- `docs/runbooks/RUNBOOK-claude-code-cloud-envs.md` — consumer-facing runbook covering which surface to pick, step-by-step for both, the secret-handling rules (no secrets in shared env-config; Doppler tokens are paste-into-session; Codespaces secrets are the only safe persistent slot), GCP auth (Workload Identity first, per-session SA-key escape hatch with `mktemp` + `CLOUDSDK_CONFIG` isolation), the canonical `AGENT_REVIEW_BYPASS` push pattern, and troubleshooting.

Tracked at [`momentiq-ai/sage-blueprint#169`](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/sage-blueprint/pull/169).

### 13.2 Non-blueprint consumers (retrofit path)

For repos that didn't scaffold from sage-blueprint, the same 5 files can be copy-pasted from the sage-blueprint template at `template/{{ '{{' }} product_slug {{ '}}' }}/`, with the four template variables substituted by hand (`product_slug` → your repo name, `doppler_project`/`doppler_config` → your Doppler scope, `github_org` → the GH org). The runbook also references the originating cycle for design rationale.

### 13.3 Design rationale + as-shipped evidence

The originating cycle is [`momentiq-ai/dark-factory-platform` → Cycle 13](https://github.com/momentiq-ai/dark-factory-platform/blob/main/docs/roadmap/cycles/cycle13-claude-code-cloud-envs.md). It documents:

- **Decisions locked at design** — why the canonical paste-in script lives in repo (not only in the env-config UI); why the Anthropic devcontainer feature is preferred over a hand-rolled Claude Code install; why `committer.email` is per-commit (not in git-config); why cloud-env pushes use the existing `AGENT_REVIEW_BYPASS` primitive (no new `CLOUD_ENV=1` shortcut); why `npm ci --include=dev` is non-negotiable.
- **Exit-criteria evidence** — a real Codespaces session reaching the prompt with `make df-doctor` clean, then a canonical-bypass push captured in the audit log verbatim. The closeout PR comment thread on DFP #166 has the full post-create stdout + audit-log line as it landed.
- **Gotchas + workarounds** — Codespaces secrets do NOT flow through `${localEnv:…}` (auto-inject by name into `containerEnv`); local VS Code Dev Containers has no user-level overlay merge mechanism, so per-user env injection is either a personal-branch overlay or manual per-session export + `bash .devcontainer/post-create.sh` re-run.

### 13.4 What's NOT in scope

- **Provisioning local subscription critics in any cloud surface.** Their OAuth requires a browser the sandbox cannot reach; Anthropic's docs explicitly disallow this on the web surface and the devcontainer docs explicitly discourage mounting Keychain state. The hosted W3 critic remains the merge gate via branch protection.
- **A "cloud-env" bypass class.** Cloud pushes use the *existing* `AGENT_REVIEW_BYPASS` primitive with a canonical reason string — same audit posture as every other bypass. No new `CLOUD_ENV=1` short-circuit was introduced (or wanted).
- **Multi-tenant fan-out / shared cloud-env config.** The scaffold is for one repo's onboarding. Org-wide cloud-env infrastructure is a separate concern.

- **Cross-repo subagent isolation:** when dispatching Claude Code subagents across multiple consumer repos in one session, each subagent MUST clone to a unique path (`/Users/<you>/projects/<repo>-wt-<task>`). Otherwise concurrent subagents trample each other's git state. This is documented in the `feedback_cross_repo_subagent_isolation` memory pattern (private to PJ's Claude Code memory).
- **A2 follow-up — CLI adapter dynamic loading:** the CLI dynamically imports vendor adapters inside `buildDefaultAdapterRegistry()` (`packages/cli/src/cli.ts` lines ~70-80) so the binary loads under `--ignore-scripts` for non-`df critic` subcommands. Don't trip over this when debugging install issues.
